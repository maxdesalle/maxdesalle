### Hey ðŸ‘‹

- I'm currently learning how to program at [19](https://www.s19.be/), a developer school based in Belgium and part of the [42 network](https://www.42.fr/42-network/). You can find all the code I'm writing for projects at 19 [here](https://github.com/maxdesalle/42).

- If you want to learn more about me, feel free to visit [my website](https://maxdesalle.com).

- If you want to reach out to me, please send me your phone number (or a link to a private note containing it) in DM either on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maxdesalle) or on [Telegram](https://t.me/maxdesalle), instead of directly messaging me the matter. I will get back to you on [Signal](https://signal.org) afterwards.
